# Exploring WebGL with React Three Fiber

The web is evolving beyond flat interfaces. With WebGL and React Three Fiber, we can create experiences that were once only possible in native applications.

## Why WebGL?

Traditional web development is 2D. We manipulate boxes, text, and images on a flat plane. But the real world is 3D, and users are increasingly expecting immersive experiences.

## The Setup

Getting started with R3F is surprisingly simple:

```tsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls, Environment } from '@react-three/drei';

function Scene() {
  return (
    <Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5] }}>
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <mesh>
        <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
      </mesh>
      <OrbitControls />
      <Environment preset="sunset" />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

## GLSL Shaders

For truly unique effects, custom shaders are essential:

```glsl
// Fragment shader for gradient effect
varying vec2 vUv;
uniform float uTime;

void main() {
  vec3 color = mix(
    vec3(0.2, 0.4, 0.8),
    vec3(0.8, 0.2, 0.4),
    sin(vUv.y * 3.14159 + uTime) * 0.5 + 0.5
  );
  gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. Use **instancing** for repeated geometries
2. **Dispose** unused resources
3. Implement **LOD** (Level of Detail) for complex scenes
4. Consider **offscreen canvas** for heavy computations

## Conclusion

React Three Fiber bridges the gap between React's declarative paradigm and Three.js's powerful 3D capabilities. It's the future of creative web development.
